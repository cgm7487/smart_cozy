## About this project
This project use an IoT cloud platform and a very simple machine learning algorithm to create a smart home system prototype.
In the first stage, this system can learn the user's preference temperature from indoor sensor data and outdoor open data.
We also want to create a more intelligent system to control everything automatically in your life as a future work.
